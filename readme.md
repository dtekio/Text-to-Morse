## **Morse Code Encoder/Decoder**
This code implements a simple Morse code encoder and decoder in Python. The main program prompts the user to choose between encoding or decoding. If decoding is chosen, the user is prompted to enter a Morse code string. If encoding is chosen, the user is prompted to enter a plaintext string. The appropriate function is called and the result is printed to the console.

## **Usage**
To use the Morse code encoder/decoder, simply run the script and follow the prompts. 

## **Limitations**
This implementation only supports the characters defined in the morse_code dictionary. It does not handle case sensitivity or punctuation marks beyond those defined in the dictionary. Additionally, the input is not sanitized or validated beyond checking for valid characters/codes, so it may not behave as expected if given unexpected input.
